Hey there! This is Abishek. Am an Indian living in Singapore. I am a Chennai-ite for what it&#8217;s worth, vegetarian by choice, an engineer by education, wanna-be maker with nothing to show for (yet). Oh, I am quite romantic about entrepreneurship. One day&#8230;

I&nbsp;work for a healthcare startup here. I am #2 and responsible for all things tech. I guess this is a good way to get started about my entrepreneur dreams!

My interests are limited to tech for the most part. I love the idea of Arduino and DIY electronics. I have a small workbench and try to tinker with these boards in my spare time. I love to code. I learn and practice half a dozen languages. The latest fad is to get comfortable with some Lisp dialect. My staple programming language is Python. 

I used to play tennis. I still have the racket and shoes! I try to run every now and then, but I lack some basic motivation to run more regularly. Now I do yoga every day.

I am fascinated by design as a discipline and try to read as much as I can on this topic. I hope to practice what I read someday. I want to practice sales/marketing at some point in my career. I strongly believe that these are the most essential blocks of an industry!
