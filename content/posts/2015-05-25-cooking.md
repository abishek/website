Noni is at her parents&#8217; for a couple of weeks. I don&#8217;t have the luxury of a work-from-home for that long, so I stayed back. There was only one thing both of us were worried about &#8211; my food. I could barely cook, forget preparing lunch and dinner amidst all the dish washing. But before Noni took the flight she prepped me up for a full week to be able to cook &#8211; more than curd rice and puliyodharai paste.

And I seem to be passing. All last week, I did the cooking. I can&#8217;t match up with Noni on the taste front, but at least am not bad. I can manage and stay healthy. Of course, I seem to forget ingredients way too often and somehow I just cannot seem to add enough salt or oil. But maybe that&#8217;s me.

There was one disaster y&#8217;day when I tried to make potato curry with Noni&#8217;s recipe inputs. But disasters have to happen if you intend to learn something properly. No disaster cooking for a full week means am not learning cooking. Am just following instructions correctly. I&#8217;d rather learn than just follow. What say?
