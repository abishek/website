I recently came across someone who called himself a &#8220;full stack&#8221; developer. By his definition of the term, I am at best a &#8220;full queue&#8221; developer. In my entire career, I have never written my own stack implementation. But I recently wrote my own working queue. I didn&#8217;t have the heart to break his illusion. I know, I should have educated him and become a better person myself. But I also know, from a lot of my students, that am the worst teacher they ever had to learn from. I don&#8217;t disagree with them.

I believe I used to be a full stack developer. That was the time when SSI clustering using openSSI and openMosix were active. Â Some of these projects haven been abandoned since! Perhaps the term was not even defined at that time. But I could administer a Linux box, set it up from scratch, secure it, tune it, compile and setup my own lamp stack, SSL certificates, implement a custom app over that stack or hack an existing project to fix it for my needs and so on. I did my own database designs and my own UI. Neither were particularly the best, but at least I could.

Today, I don&#8217;t think I even know all the pieces that make a cloud stack! Let alone set them up on my own. Part of the reason is that I moved away from that sort of work in pursuit of a different dream. But part of me still longs to get back there. Maybe I will. But the things have changed so much, I have a lot to catch up to get on the edge.
