So we are entering a certain level of uncertainty in our lives this year. Many times the uncertainty are related to my wishes and hopes about my future. About our future. About our dreams for our future.

This time it is different. And hopefully we come out stronger when this has passed. Of course, for the first time, we have very little give or take from the outcomes. We have a wish-list for what we expect to happen. The rest is just as ok too.
