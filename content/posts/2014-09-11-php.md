I began my career in software writing PHP code. I used to like it so much that I tried to use php for even non-web scripting. I actually improved much of my c skill set by writing a PHP module!

Then came along python. I like python so much that I haven&#8217;t written any PHP code since. And now, after all these years, I have to write some PHP code again. 

The experience is refreshing. I seem to have forgotten a good portion of it, though. And the docs at their website is still the best way ðŸ™‚
