A good friend shared this article with me &#8211; [Why I want you to steal my ideas][1].  If you didn&#8217;t already know from the title, this one is by the renowned blogger Seth Godin. I love Seth&#8217;s work and I read his blog regularly. Some of his writings are very thought provoking and makes you want to re-evaluate your stand on many day-to-day things. Here is my favorite line from the above link.

> Ideas can’t be stolen, because ideas don’t get smaller when they’re shared, they get bigger
