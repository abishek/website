I sometimes wonder if I should just enroll and do a certificate course in UX. UX, not UI &#8211; my visual sensibilities are a tad retarded, but I am good at spotting failures. And I love research. I may not be the best guy to talk to people yet, but I haven&#8217;t tried that first hand as well. So maybe I can learn.

I think UX is a very interesting topic. A good understanding of the principles and knowledge of how to apply them to a system/product/solution/problem at hand is an immensely useful skill to have. Of course, I don&#8217;t think it will fetch me any salary to start, but maybe I will be good at it. And If I am good, then I think I can get closer to the design field that I believe is the next most important horizontal going forward.

Not just that &#8211; I have a problem with most things that are dysfunctional; even slightly. And by being in this field, I maybe able to change some of them. And maybe the future generations can have better products/solutions.

Ambitious? Well, yes. About time.
