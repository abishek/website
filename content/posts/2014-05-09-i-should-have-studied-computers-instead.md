&#8230; That&#8217;s a thought that keeps hitting me every now and then. I am reasonably good at my work (or) at least not so bad that somebody had to ask me get my act straight. Yet. 

I definitely like what I do. So that&#8217;s not where it starts either. But sometimes, computers are all that fascinate me. I can probably design one of my own in some years, it still doesn&#8217;t count for actually getting one to do what you want it to! Need for superiority?

Nope. I&#8217;d not acknowledge that anyway. But I think it has something to do with my inclination to math. And for some reason, most of the computer science that I taught myself had a lot of mathematics in it &#8211; linear algebra when learning algorithms, some graph theory for my thesis work and now linear algebra again for ML. 

Maybe I should give this another chance? Maybe yes, if I can find something that won&#8217;t need me to just fill in code but do some quality work around analysis or algorithms. But with my qualification, that&#8217;s going to need what I call a &#8220;miracle&#8221;
