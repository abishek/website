Someone was asking a friend who his 1yr old resembled. Each of us had an opinion. But there is truly very little you can say at this point in the kid&#8217;s journey.&nbsp;

For a long time everyone in the house believed I strongly resembled my maternal uncles and my maternal grandma. True that given my hair texture and general attitude.&nbsp;

Similarly, for a long time everyone in the house believed that my sister resembled my paternal grandma. Given her frame and general mannerisms, it made sense as well.&nbsp;

Until a couple of years back, that is. We stumbled upon dad&#8217;s high school pic and mom&#8217;s college pics. If they didn&#8217;t have the sepia tint and the worn down texture, one cannot tell apart my mom&#8217;s college pics from my sister&#8217;s. And ignoring the hair texture, you cannot tell apart my dad&#8217;s pics &nbsp;from mine. So much for resemblances.&nbsp;

We always see in a person, who we want to see in them. We rarely see them for who they are, or who they actually resemble.&nbsp;
