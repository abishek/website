What I am about to discuss here is not a basic need. It is more of a luxury, good to have setup. Nobody quite misses it now, but maybe it will become essential in the future. Or maybe not.

During the formative years of the foetus, parents get to see their baby(-ies) take shape through the months with the help of the ultra sound scans that the doctor uses. For the first 6-7 months, the baby is still not very active. But around 7 months, it becomes quite active and is almost able to listen to sounds from outside and maybe also responds to them. Usually, you would have to be in luck to see this happen during a regular checkup visit. And not a lot of us would be that lucky.

Wouldn&#8217;t it be interesting to have ultrasound sessions that aren&#8217;t diagnostic? Say you could book a slot with a ultrasound technician and spend 1-1 time with your unborn kid? You could speak to the kid and see the reactions. Maybe you can use these sessions to take good pictures of your kid for archival. There can be other things around this system &#8211; pictures, albums, video recordings, 3d printed take-aways, holograms of the foetal positions etc.

So would you want one? Maybe you cannot judge unless you have a kid?
