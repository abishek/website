I came across this [post from Seth][1]. And hence this [challenge link][2]. I have enough reasons to participate. And I have a big ball of laziness that says I should not commit to anything publicly.

Let me see. I am giving myself a day to decide. Maybe I&#8217;ll convince myself that I can actually publish everyday for at least 7 days in my life.

It is my turn to challenge myself.
