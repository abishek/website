I came across this tutorial in [pyroelectro][2]. I wanted to try it out myself without completing the tutorial. I used a few hints from the tutorial and came up with a working system. This is pretty much the same as the one in tutorial, just that I don&#8217;t have the 7-segment display.

I implemented using an Arduino UNO and some discrete components. I have a breadboard solution working now and am planning to make a protoboard version as well. Â My Arduino code is available on <a title="Arduino Adventures | GitHub" href="https://github.com/abishek/arduino-adventures/tree/master/led_game" target="_blank" rel="noopener">github</a>.
