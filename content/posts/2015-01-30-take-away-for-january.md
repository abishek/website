Read this post from Seth Godin. I found it profound and enlightening, even outside of the marketing paradigm that Seth talks about in.

In fact, this is completely in line with &#8220;The Secret&#8221;, another book that I&#8217;d recommend a read. I&#8217;ve never managed to read it through so far, though.

As simple as that. Go finish one thing today.
