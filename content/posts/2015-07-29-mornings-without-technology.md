As usual, I have started running another experiment.But this is only two days young. I should wait for another month or so to see if I really hold this up. The routine is the SAVERS routine that I came across in techcrunch or mashable recently.

The actual routine is like this:

  * Sit in silence; Meditate
  * Affirmations
  * Visualizations
  * Exercise &#8211; my usual yoga
  * Reading &#8211; currently &#8220;War of the worlds by H.G.Wells&#8221;
  * Scribe &#8211; for the first time, am writing a journal with pen and paper.

Each of the steps, except exercise is about 5-10 mins long. Overall it costs me about an hour or so to finish. But the best part of this is, I don&#8217;t touch my iPhone or mac until this is done. And usually, there are some tasks like watering the plants and replacing dry plates and cutlery back in their aisles. Then I have only enough time to give myself a bath and start for work. Of course, I don&#8217;t wake up that late either. I just managed to start work quite early on both these days. Maybe most other days, I ll have a lot of spare time.

Of course, I don&#8217;t know how I will use the newly acquired time. I know I have a tonne of things I could do. Maybe I&#8217;ll do or maybe I&#8217;ll still crib I don&#8217;t have enough time. But I have some other uses for staying away from technology as much as I can; something that is not ready to be discussed on these pages yet.
