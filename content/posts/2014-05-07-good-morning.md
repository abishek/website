I usually take a bus to work around 930 in the morning. Late, yes, but I usually start my work day at 8. Anyway, that&#8217;s not the point. 

I usually manage to catch the same bus &#8211; by time, route and the driver! And for two reasons. One is, duh, that&#8217;s the first bus around this time. 

Second is the driver! This guy gives you a &#8220;good morning!&#8221; as you board the bus. And I usually wish him back. And this simple exchange brightens up my mood for a very long time into the day.
