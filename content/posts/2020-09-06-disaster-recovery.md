I briefly lost the site to a sysadmin disaster. Although I didn&#8217;t quite create the disaster on my own, I had to clean up after a failed upgrade script. Anyway, the site is back up and even if I don&#8217;t have much to say in it. It took me about 15 minutes to fix it. The exact 15 minutes I didn&#8217;t feel like spending for over two weeks when the disaster first occurred. 

It is very funny how very untechnical I am becoming these days. About 5 years back, I used to live for these disasters ðŸ™‚
