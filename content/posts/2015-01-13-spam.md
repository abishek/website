I wonder how stupid the spam crawler bots are. I get really silly and extremely obvious comments that scream of beingÂ just a script.

I guess they need some good machine learning algorithms to check which blogs to spam. And then what to spam.

At the very least, pay to get akismet database to see how they classify spam. Then see how to beat that. Pointlessly writing on blogs that have no visitors can only waste the spammers internet bandwidth. Right?
