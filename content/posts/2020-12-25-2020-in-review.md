Even at the cost of annoying folks around me, I&#8217;d dare say that 2020 has actually been a fabulous year for me, personally. I learnt quite a bit about myself, learnt a couple of new skills, learnt what I don&#8217;t like, what I don&#8217;t want to do, fixed a couple of things about my health and more. I&#8217;ll try to chronicle these for the rest of the post. I typically consider my date of birth as the beginning of another year. And for a long time, I wrote up my aspirations for the year ahead. But a couple of years back, I found that I couldn&#8217;t keep pace with my aspirations and looking back was a tragic opportunity cost all around me. So I stopped doing this. This year, though, I&#8217;ll try and redo the aspirations for the year ahead. But I&#8217;ll also try to stay realistic.

### Working From Home

I&#8217;ve always envisioned working from home as the epitome of working a job. I just happen to be in an industry that is privileged to allow this mode of working. And this year, I was able to put it to test. Even in the last couple of years, I worked from home for a couple of days every week. But predominant mode was commute to workplace. I hate commuting to work &#8211; almost inexplicably so. This year my work output has been at least comparable to all the years so far if not better. I work at the hours that am most comfortable with, I get to spend time with my kid, I get to spend time with my learning programmes and I also get to watch the shows I really feel like and when am not really doing anything better. I have a weird issue while working: if I need to focus on a problem, I need to be distracted from it. So if I have a show running on TV, I typically tend to do better. Of course, the show cannot be engaging. For instance, I have completed most home improvement, cooking and talk shows on Netflix available here in Singapore. Cooking shows are the best given that I cannot eat most of what is being cooked, so there is no engagement. But I learn a few things here and there and gives me the optimal distraction I need to complete my work! Overall, I&#8217;d call my &#8220;work from home&#8221; experiment a grand success. I&#8217;d do this a lot more going forward and maybe commute once a week to show people what I really look like.

### Fixing My Health

My health wasn&#8217;t at its best. I wasn&#8217;t in a bad place, but given my age I could do a lot better. So I decided to do something about it this year. I was lurking around vegetarian keto forums and the like, until I landed on a guided transformation programme. As of writing this, I am still in the programme and I&#8217;ve come quite far from where I was earlier this year. I hope to keep this going and ensure I have a healthy decade ahead of me ðŸ™‚

That said, I am proud of what I have achieved in this space and thanks to the lean year, I was able to follow through this one without much hassles.

### Learning New Stuff

This is the category where this year scores the most for me.

#### Common Lisp

I started learning Common Lisp a couple of years back. I mostly started because of two reasons:

  1. many reputed developers were always tweeting about the benefits of learning to write lisp code
  2. I heard about the Lisp machine, someone ported it to FPGAs and I really wanted to see if I can port my master&#8217;s thesis to the Lisp Machine.

But learning Lisp wasn&#8217;t easy. I still don&#8217;t think I have gotten there. Besides going from Python to Lisp is a tad difficult. Lispers revel in writing their stuff than in using libraries. Pythonistas use a library first &#8211; at least a good many of us do. That said, I embarked on this journey a couple of years back and I have finally gotten to a place where I can write decent code. I spent a good part of my time early this year working on exercism. Here is my [profile][1] ðŸ™‚

I managed to start one project of my own and joined another open source project as a contributor. It&#8217;s not much but its a start! I have linked them below in a different section.

#### Machine Learning

I, finally, managed to complete [Andrew Ng&#8217;s course on Coursera for Machine Learning][2]. It is somewhat an achievement because I&#8217;ve had more false starts on this course than anything else. I also audited most of [Ramaseshan&#8217;s course on Natural Language Processing][3]. This is still work in progress for me and I hope to complete it in the next year. My personal target for next year is to be reasonably proficient in NLP techniques. I have a long way to go and to my credit, Ramaseshan&#8217;s course is very detailed and I need to give it the time it needs to absorb all the details he presents there. I know it is detailed because I have also completed half a dozen other introduction to NLP courses that leave you nowhere near knowing what you need to know.

#### Content Marketing

On the non-technical side, I completed 4-5 Hubspot courses on content marketing, video creation and editing and the like. I really needed these to support our company in scaling up our inbound strategies. I am sort of proud of myself here because I was able to apply these learnings and start us off on a nice campaign that helped us connect to a good subscriber base across multiple social channels. So I did learn something. I sometimes wish I were a tad more creative with the tools. But hey, I have no regrets in this space. While I cannot create a beautiful poster myself, I can give enough feedback and specifications for a creative person to generate versions within a few hours. I guess I&#8217;ve grown quite a bit in this space as well.

#### Languages

I learnt a good amount of the Korean language. Don&#8217;t ask why! I really dunno why. I started watching a bunch of K-Dramas on Netflix because I liked their themes. Then I got drawn to how much importance they were giving to their cultures and traditions. At this point, I continued watching because I was keen on drawing parallels between what I know of my culture and what was being presented as their culture. Some day I&#8217;ll write my findings up and trust me, its brilliant. I use the drips app to learn more of the language. I&#8217;ve come as far as being able to understand simple sentences without subtitles. I&#8217;ve paused this for now &#8211; to reapply the experiment on Thai. For two reasons: I have a lot of respect for the Thais (after Japanese, duh!) and because we need to enter the Thai market for our product and like the French, Thai aren&#8217;t very keen on speaking in English.

#### Books

I started 5 very interesting books this year. I haven&#8217;t completed any at this time of writing. But I expect to finish all of them in 2021. I loved each of the topics. Some of them require a deeper reading and takes much longer to turn a page. Here is my list for 2021:

  * [Hooked by Nir Eyal][4]
  * [Start With Why by Simon Sinek][5]
  * [Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman][6]
  * [The Power Of Habit by Charles Duhigg][7]
  * [Hackers by Steven Levy][8]
  * [Talking to Strangers by Malcolm Gladwell][9]

Hackers and Talking to Strangers are the lightest reads but somehow I haven&#8217;t managed to finish reading either of them this year.

While this list is open, I have three more books in the queue that I hope to finish reading in 2021 as well. These are:

  * [From The Beginning Of Time by Ganesh Swaminathan][10]
  * [The Practice by Seth Godin][11]
  * [Atomic Habits by James Clear][12]

#### Meditation

Like Machine Learning, Meditation is a space where I have had way too many false starts. A couple of years back, I started with headspace. That didn&#8217;t stick. I tried spiritual training stuff and those didn&#8217;t stick either. This year, I discovered the Medito app. I use it occasionally to help me sleep better. Recently, I came across a &#8220;heart fullness&#8221; meditation project. I sort of have signed up for it. I hope to practice this year and eventually acquire this skill.

### Open Source

I am a big fan of open source. But I&#8217;ve never quite contributed myself. It is not that I couldn&#8217;t or wouldn&#8217;t, but it never quite worked out that way. This year, I submitted a couple of bug reports and patch to a python pdf library that I wanted for my work. I liked the idea so much that I started a bunch of open source projects of my own. I hope to have these into RC next year and publicise them a little to get others to take it forward or fork to build their own. I have more ideas that are going open source in the next year. Here are the significant ones.

  1. [Nastafile][13] &#8211; a Common Lisp NNTP to HTML dump tool for archiving mailing lists.
  2. [Bookmarks-manager][14] &#8211; A Common Lisp web-based pocket rival.
  3. [Cows and Bulls][15] &#8211; An android implementation of the popular cows and bulls game.
  4. [Code Finder][16] &#8211; Part of an intelligent code assistant that am trying to build as part of the build2learn initiative.

I have started a couple more &#8211; A charting library in Common Lisp to generate SVG charts from datasets, a simple BI tool in python and a couple of iOS projects too.

### In Summary

While the whole world was reeling from a pandemic, it feels odd to think I actually had a very productive year. But it wasn&#8217;t all easy. I had a lot of trouble managing my anxiety at the beginning of the pandemic. I used to get overly worried and I even had eczema on my hands &#8211; probably due to excessive hand washing. It took a good 2-3 months before I could come to terms with the whole reality. Even now I&#8217;m the most paranoid fellow in the house but its cool. I don&#8217;t spiral off into anxiety and I stopped reading a whole lot of news/Twitter/Reddit relating to COVID. I just stick to headlines once a day and never the details.

I also spent a good amount of time reflecting on what I really want to achieve in my life. I always held this thought &#8211; I received education from very premier institutes. I technically am very privileged for the life I have. I know people that would gladly give me an opportunity. Making something off the opportunity is still my problem, but I know so many folks who&#8217;d shine if only someone gave them a chance! I don&#8217;t want to be an invisible person who didn&#8217;t do anything with the privilege that he got handed out on a platter. I really have to make something of myself, create a legacy while making this world a little bit better than it has been for me. And that is my wish for the next decade. If at the turn of 2030, I have achieved or on a path to achieve this legacy, I guess my privilege will be returned to the society rightfully.

Here is to 2021 that takes us all to a better place. I hope the new normal is better, healthier, less scary and more fun and I hope 2021 can usher in that normal. And if you did read this far, thank you and wish you a very happy new year.
