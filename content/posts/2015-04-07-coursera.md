I have tried to learn stuff via coursera only to give up quarter way. Usually am off after the first week or so. This has nothing to do with the difficulty or anything. Usually, my work spikes immediately after I sign up for a course. I&#8217;d miss a week or two of assignments. And then I ll loose interest.&nbsp;

I am trying again now. Let&#8217;s see how far this goes.&nbsp;
