Some people are not even worth getting pissed off at. Either they don&#8217;t know that they are doing it wrong or they are plain stupid to see what they are doing wrong.&nbsp;

It gets downhill from there when such a person is also a top boss in the office. God save me. And my anger.&nbsp;

It&#8217;s definitely not worth it. Not this guy definitely. You can get angry with someone who is reasonable. Because then they will see why you did.&nbsp;
