Moved from Justhost to GoDaddy. And got myself a domain. And SSL&#8217;ed it as well.

It has taken me 6 odd months, $80 and a lifetime of lethargy to get this done. Finally, what really got me to do it is a desperate need to bring back my blog online so that I can write down a bunch of things.

Motivation is a tough sell.
