So, the new year is here. Happy New Year.

The day has been fabulous to say the least. In that sense, the year has started off on a great note.

The very first thing I did in the morning was a pending DIY worktable. The work is not complete, but is about 50% complete. And this is great, because this is what I want to do the rest of the year &#8211; do stuff myself.

Secondly I watched this movie called &#8220;PK&#8221;. Not a bad idea. Asks many interesting questions, raises many important points and does feels a tad preachy at places. But overall a very nice watch.

Noni and I had been considering making some contributions to some society or the other. Actually, we have been considering volunteering in person as well. But I&#8217;ll talk about that when something materialises. Today, we managed to make a small change to 365 Cancer Prevention Society through a kind volunteer. We hope to keep that up as long as we monetarily can!

Yeah, we didn&#8217;t manage the usual temple visit. But I guess we fared better than that already.

Happy New Year.
