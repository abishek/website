So I came across Myer Brigg&#8217;s type indicator test when I was reading something on Quora. The geek that I am, I had to try it out first. I haven&#8217;t read up about it yet, but I felt the need to write something I noticed. And so here it is. 

This test is sorta like a psychometry test. I was told, during interview days just after finishing engineering school, that these tests were used to identify your personality, whether you were clear in your head or some such stuff. I never actually gave one, but was always preparing myself for one. It so happens that I quickly learnt to locate the patterns and game the test!

As I started taking this test, I noticed that I was automatically gaming my answers. Damn! That&#8217;s no way to know my personality! Oh wait, maybe it already tells me a lot about my personality anyhow
