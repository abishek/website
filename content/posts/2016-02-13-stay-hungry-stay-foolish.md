I am a Jobs&#8217; fan. I mean, by now you must already know this. I have heard his &#8220;Stanford commencement address&#8221; almost once a month ever since I came across it. I take inspiration from many of his quotes. I don&#8217;t want to be another Jobs. I just like his example.

But unlike most Jobs fans, my favourite quote wasn&#8217;t &#8220;Stay Hungry, Stay Foolish&#8221;. Simply because I never understood what it meant. At least not until now. But maybe I understand now and so maybe I&#8217;ll join the drones of others who love this quote as well.

My misunderstanding was that somehow staying foolish and staying hungry were connected to each other. So I took for granted that the author of the quote &#8211; &#8220;last edition of the whole earth catalog&#8221; &#8211; meant for its readers to make money because it would be foolish to just stay hungry. As in, its in your hands to not remain hungry. Something along those lines. Crazy and childish, right? Exactly why I didn&#8217;t quite like the quote.

But I never left it there. I kept pondering over the quote in the back of my mind. And almost suddenly, y&#8217;day, a different meaning appeared in my head. And I think it makes better sense. Here is what I think it means:

Stay Hungry and Stay Foolish are connected. But not to each other. They are both indicative of a state of mind. You need to remain hungry for information. And you need to retain an element of foolishness. Actually, what you need is an element of inquisitiveness which eventually will border on foolishness. Stay foolish and don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s a bad thing. Staying foolish is a good way to learn more and progress ahead.

Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish. Always.
