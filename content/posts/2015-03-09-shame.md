Sometimes it&#8217;s a shame to do some things. It&#8217;s a shame to not do anything about what is important to you. It&#8217;s a shame to feel helpless when what you love is snatched right from your hand and you don&#8217;t even raise an eyebrow. It&#8217;s a shame to let someone think you are at their mercy. And it&#8217;s a shame to believe that someone is in your mercy.&nbsp;

At this point in time, I feel ashamed about myself. This is not who I set out to be. Yet this is not the time to act. I choose to remain shameless until it is time to act. Because not everyone or everything is fair.&nbsp;

I can only quote George Orwell&#8217;s &#8220;Animal Farm&#8221; &#8211;&nbsp;

> All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.&nbsp;

Lack of equality is perhaps the first failure of education.&nbsp;
