Funny that I should talk about music. But anyway, laugh all you want. I am going to talk about something related to music.

After a long time, I liked what I heard in OK Kanmani songs. I didn&#8217;t quite care about the lyric, but I didn&#8217;t find it obscene. Yeah, that&#8217;s been a while when the song is not obscene. And its more obscene to hear kids mouth the lyrics innocently. Somebody really robbed them off their innocence without telling them about it.

Back to topic, OK Kanmani songs are very interesting. The last time I found the songs were interesting is for 180. Of course, there were a few catchy singles here and there. Even Kadal had one or two that were not bad. And before that&nbsp;Vinnai Thandi Varuvaaya. I don&#8217;t know if I heard and liked any hindi song in the meanwhile. One song in Viswaroopam was good. I think that&#8217;s about it. I&#8217;ll need to really rack my brain to locate some others, which makes them sort of irrelevant, I guess. Before that it was Alaipayuthey, I think.

Well, maybe my taste in music is really not what the tamil industry likes to sing.
