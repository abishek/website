If the mum is to be believed, A used to roll in the street pavement crying out loud. He always needed a car toy that the street vendor sold. But A had great ethics even as young as a 1yr old! He never asked for the same toy twice, and never asked for more than one toy. And A had already mastered persuasion by embarrassment &#8211; perhaps a sign of things to come?

Mum usually relented fast &#8211; an act of damage control you might say. But this happened in the holy town and most passers-by would sympathize with the boy anyway!

The dad wouldn&#8217;t give in so fast, though. Ranganathan St and Pondy Bazaar have seen way more adamant young boys than A. But A still managed to get that car. And occasionally a bottle of bubbles.
