Starting this weekend, I plan to write one post every week. Oh, the one post a day plan is still on &#8211; but as you can see it is not quite there yet. But this weekly post is a slightly different idea &#8211; one that hopefully will help me connect back to my original intentions.

You might be aware of my arduino daily. It is an automatically generated page from paper.li . That&#8217;s quite good and quite a few people do like the effort. I do too which is why I created it in the first place. But as I have grown to learn, it lacks some thing. The missing bit, I believe, is the personal touch.

So starting this weekend, I am going to collect all the links that I found interesting through the week. Things that I have read and liked. And I will stick to hobby electronics and/or IoE to start.

Let me know if you think this is redundant.
