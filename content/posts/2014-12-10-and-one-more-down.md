Am slowly and steadily getting used to this. I have an idea, I and Noni discuss it a bit and figure out even we might not use it. I still have a hunch feeling that it is a worthy idea, but don&#8217;t pursue it anyway. A few days/weeks/months later I read an article about a new company or a product line formed with exactly the same idea.

Today morning was no different. It is difficult to start the day feeling like a &#8220;Loser&#8221; and walk around as if nothing ever happened. But am getting better at this. Surely. Slowly, but surely.
