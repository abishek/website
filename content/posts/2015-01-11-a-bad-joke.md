We were walking down to Velocity@Novena y&#8217;day evening. The subway leading to the Novena MRT felt very slippery. And I was wearing a pair of slippers. That got me thinking &#8211; how can slippers be slippery? Apart from that the sole is really worn out, but mine are quite ok.

Slippers seem like a bad name for footwear; it sounds as if slippers are meant to slip, right? They should have been called something else. I know most of you call it flip-flops these days. Perhaps, they realised this ahead of me.

We thought about the etymology of the word _Slipper_. It should have been &#8220;aslipper&#8221; &#8211; unslipper didn&#8217;t quite feel right. But then there are always two in a pair and aslipper sounds singular. So a pair of aslippers is slipper.

It is quite important to understand the root of things, you know.
