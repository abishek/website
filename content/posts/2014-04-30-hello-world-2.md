I&#8217;ve been blogging on and off at various sites including wordpress and blogger. I&#8217;ve also tried consolidating a bunch of them a bunch of times. But given how haphazard my habits are, consolidation is never complete. 

This time around I have decided to stop using all the other tools and stick to this one alone. I self host it and that presumably gives me more control. It also makes it vulnerable, but I don&#8217;t know who on earth wants to control my site! 

I ll continue to remain haphazard and just hope I can fix the site to make things look orderly and organized. And also, I want to write everyday. I will write only humor, tech or philosophy. But I am neither a comedian nor a philosopher. That really enables me to write a lot of meaningless stuff. 

Oh! I am not a tech guru either. But world does have a place for a quack or two, right?
