I stumbled upon this pure genius on Netflix by serendipity. And I don&#8217;t think I have laughed as much on anything else. This is the kind of absurd humour that I enjoy the most &#8211; I wonder what that says about me, sometimes.

This genre is somewhat hard to find, though. For a long time, it was only the Monty Pythons that worked on this genre. Then I stumbled upon Douglas Adams and haven&#8217;t looked back since. I think Douglas Adams is the absolute epitome of this genre. There are so many instances in the hitch hiker&#8217;s book that I still reminisce and laugh over. Dirk Gently, incidentally, is from Douglas Adams too.

I have longed for this genre in Tamil. There have been a few over time, but mostly in bits and pieces. I think Crazy Mohan&#8217;s &#8220;Crazy Thieves in Palavakkam&#8221; is the first one that comes to my mind. There were instances in movies like &#8220;Kaasedan Kadavulada&#8221; and &#8220;Kadhalikka Neramillai&#8221; etc. But nothing that went all the way. Even &#8220;Thillu Mullu&#8221; has a few brilliant absurdist moments. I think the first film I remember was &#8220;Mumbai Xpress&#8221;. Things changed recently though &#8211; Neram, Soodhu Kavvum, Moodar Koodam and Sutta Kadhai. I have watched Moodar Koodam half a dozen times!

Frankly, I think this genre takes a genius to write. Most forms of humour are based on day to day behavioural observations or stereotyping. A few people transcend this level to create humour that builds on criticism. But absurdist humour requires us to create something that doesn&#8217;t exist. It&#8217;s so silly that you need to think like a child to come up with this stuff. Most of us are logical beings. The basis of absurdist humour is illogical. And that requires a fair amount of genius for an ordinary person to create.
