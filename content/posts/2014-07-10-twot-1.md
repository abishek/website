This one is long due &#8211; More than a week. A small note and the links I stumbled upon and was delighted to know. I&#8217;ll update every week, hopefully.

1) Ever wanted to code during a presentation and get it right in front of all the audience? Here&#8217;s what you may need!

This was fun knowing and hope to use it some day when I host a code hackathon or code demo ðŸ™‚

2) I am always kind of fond of parallel programming. I even did my thesis work on CUDA. Someday I wanted to be able to write parallel programs in Python. Then I read about GIL. Last week I read something about using the &#8220;multiprocessing&#8221; module in python. This one seems good and I hope to use it some day soon.

3) Ever considered building a projector at home? I did and have succeeded to variable degrees. Last week I read an article that teaches you how to build a Laser projector. I wish to try this someday.

4) And finally two posts for becoming better programmers
