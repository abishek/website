Noni and I spotted this poster on Orchard road. It was an ad for a movie playing &#8211; one of the many as part of the SG50 celebrations. Sorry about the bad picture quality, its sort of necessary to make the point.&nbsp;

Noni said &#8220;wait, doesn&#8217;t this guy look a lot like KamalHassan?&#8221;&nbsp;

I said &#8220;yeah! What&#8217;s better? The guy next to him looks a lot like Rajini Kanth&#8221;

They had to be. It was a poster for &#8220;Ninaithale Inikkum&#8221;, a cult movie and a personal favourite. The interesting piece is this: the younger selves of both Rajini and Kamal only look like them.

In a way, that&#8217;s great. I don&#8217;t look anything like what I did in school, though you will easily see the resemblances. For Noni, the changes are even more vivid. It does take something to be in showbiz!
