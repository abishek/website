So, I am running behind schedule by one post. I definitely have to catch up and fix. Or my eventual ambition of writing my biography would become a dream!

Why would I write my bio? Simple, how else will the world know my existence. 

Why should they know? Good one. Maybe for what I am today, they are better off not knowing. But by the time I get to writing my bio, I would be someone they might as well know!

And why is that? I dunno. Why won&#8217;t they?

This can go on. But no one can change my mind. And the eventual bio is brewing.
