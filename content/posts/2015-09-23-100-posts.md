This is my hundredth post on the blog. I got here in less than two years, averaging > two posts a week. But the distribution is not that even. Maybe it is time to have this blog more noticed and have people read and give me a piece of their minds. For a start, I&#8217;ll publish the links to my first circle of friends. 

I definitely like to write. But I can&#8217;t write on a cue. It takes a lot of interest in a topic for me to write about it. That is why a good majority of the posts are about how I view the events in my life. And the next major topic is technology and programming. There are a few ideas tossed around too, but they usually come under tech.

I&#8217;ll try to keep this pace: keyword being &#8220;try&#8221;.
