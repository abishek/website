Two years of iPhone has served me very well. Now I need to renew my contract and I can get another device with the new contract. I could forgo a device, but I may not be able to get a device in the contract later on. So, it put me in a fix. Fix because the contract does not support picking a 5S device. Or even a 4S device. And I am not sure if I want to lug around a bigger handset than that. iPhone 6 is big. Its bigger than I like a personal handset to be. Maybe I am stuck in the 2000s and the world has moved on. But I can choose to remain in my own little time warp, can&#8217;t I?

Worser still, because these new devices are more expensive, I need to shell out at least S$300 to keep staying with AAPL. S$300 for a device I am not convinced? My iPhone is quite good, thinking about it. I don&#8217;t really need to upgrade the device. And my usage is so pathetically bad, I don&#8217;t really need a better device. All I do is call FT Audio, some whatsapp and occasional browsing, medium, feedly, twitter and gmail. Barring medium, am sure the rest are quite functional &#8211; if not better &#8211; in android. And since I don&#8217;t post using medium, I can read it quite fine on a web browser.

I can gladly get a 4.7&#8243; or bigger android device for S$0 with my upgrade. Maybe that is what I&#8217;ll do. I&#8217;ll take an android with the upgrade and keep using the iPhone 5 until it gives up and dies. Hopefully, someone in AAPL is sympathetic to old fools like me and decide to re-introduce a 4&#8243; device later on. If they do that, I could upgrade to that and stay loyal. Or I&#8217;ll slowly try to convince myself that 4.7&#8243; is the new 4&#8243; and acclimatize myself with a cheaper device first. Then perhaps I can convince myself to pay a bigger price tag for a iDevice.

There is another reason for this thought. App development on ios is quite easy. I could write two apps without any formal training in the subject. But I need to put in $99 to test it on the device. And I don&#8217;t know if I want to do that. That said, if I can&#8217;t give $99 to test the app, where am I going to give S$300 to upgrade the device? On the other hand, android won&#8217;t need me to do that. Even if it did, I could root the device and move to CM and own the device. And maybe I&#8217;ll still need to pay up for putting my app on the store &#8211; but at least I can use my app on my phone without having to pay anyone yet. Of course, I don&#8217;t know if app development is as simple as in ios. But judging by the number of apps, it can&#8217;t be very difficult.

Am still speculating. Maybe I&#8217;ll do just this. Or maybe I&#8217;ll shell S$300 and pick something I won&#8217;t want. Or maybe I&#8217;ll pick it and sell it or exchange it in the family. Or maybe I&#8217;ll just learn fast.
