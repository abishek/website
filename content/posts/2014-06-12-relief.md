It feels good, sometimes, to know that you were not the only one to make certain mistakes. Or that you were not the only one in your situation. Sadistic as it may sound, I think I just got to talk to another person who shares my story. While I wish him the best in his endeavors, I wish I had known him earlier or spoke more often.

For a fact, when I told a few of my friends in Cognizant that I was leaving the company to research at IITM, most of them said &#8211; &#8220;you gotta be crazy! why would you waste your life? And what can IITM give you that CTS cannot already? Just talk to your manager and get one or two onsite opportunities and you&#8217;ll be just fine!&#8221;. Sometimes I have wondered if they were correct. But the experience and inspiration I got from my stint at IITM is unparalleled. Nothing to look back and regret.

When I raised a similar thought recently, I got a very warm &#8211; &#8220;welcome to the club&#8221; response.Â  I guess, after all, am not all that alone. Relief, truly. Sadistic, but still relief.
