but it is private. Perhaps, firing is not a politically correct word in the first place.

Our jobs could be on the line for reasons that don&#8217;t include us. And we need to accept that as a fact first. I recently came across a post where someone was getting terminated and were pissed off at how they didn&#8217;t give them a proper reason for termination. Well, if you think about it, one of the lines in the employment contract would say that the company reserves the right to not give you any reason.

On the other hand, the person handing over the termination forms should also be aware of what it is to be on the other side. Especially in countries like India where termination is seen as a black mark in one&#8217;s career chart. The fact is, _it is not_. It means nothing unless the letter obviously quotes performance. I am sure no sensible company would quote a reason on the letter. They all want to ensure you can continue on your path, if not necessarily with them.

While I feel bad for the people that are getting relieved, I do feel they should have seen this coming. And prepared for it, mentally. WeÂ all should learn to see these as gifts of time, when we get to sit down and reflect on our path forward instead of mindlessly getting the next job. Getting fired is just another occupational hazard. _It need not be serious._
