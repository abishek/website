So I got about 60% of oneÂ app working on my iPhone to a satisfactory extent. I still need to add a couple of features before it can used as an app. I thought this is perhaps a good time to think about and generally fix the horrible UI that I have created so far.

Thinking about it, I suck so bad at UI that I have never written a GUI application all my life. I briefly dabbed with GTK, PyGTK, PyQT, Tk-Wish, WxWidgets and a bunch of others (including VB and VC++). I failed at each one of them. As in the buttons usually clicked and the labels and tables got updated as needed always. But I was never proud of how it looked. I almost hated myself for this failure. But then I stumbled upon websites of many programmers (friends, some times stuff that I just stumble upon) and found that most of them were really bad. And they didn&#8217;t seem to have a problem with it. That is when I started feeling very good about myself &#8211; at least I could see that my work is not presentable, even if it was worth presenting.

For web development, it was quite easy. I started using open source CSS templates and mostly got away with decent looking stuff. If I tried to fix a color or two, I&#8217;d definitely leave a patch. So I never did that. I usually told people that things couldn&#8217;t be changed and that it was too difficult. In reality, the change itself was extremely straightforward. But matching the UI was a big issue. And UX was something I never heard about. And as the guy who wrote it, I always am able to use the tool like a pro. So I always found it completely usable. Until about 4 years back when I started learning usability. But because of these issues, I largely stuck to CLI apps. But I usually take care to handle reasonable UX in the CLI apps.

I have written a handful of apps, so far, on ios. Nothing that I am proud enough of to try to put on the app store. Now I have an app that I want used by Noni. Of course, she can understand where the bad UI/UX is coming from. And maybe she&#8217;ll find it thoroughly usable since she works day in/day out with engineers like me. I don&#8217;t know if I should procrastinate further to try and get a reasonably good UI or just give her the damn working version first and then worry about the UI later.

I&#8217;ll give myself another day or two to make the decision. And yeah, I&#8217;ll make another post to show you how bad the UI can be..
