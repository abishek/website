I sometimes think Seth Godin has a team that just spies on me to give him inputs on what he should write about. Because there are so many instances where his post for the day directly answers something I have been pondering over or ranting about to Noni. Ask her, she&#8217;d vouch for this.

I find it difficult to accept most of his advice, though. I think I have my feet too deep in staying afloat that I am super scared to change any of that. Hopefully, someday I&#8217;ll be able to follow at least a portion of his writing. 

On the other hand, it is quite scary to think that my dilemma is shared by a large group of people. Why else would Seth write about what he writes? Unless my spy theory is actually correct.
