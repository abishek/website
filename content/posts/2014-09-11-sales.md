I want to learn to sell. I get this feeling that selling is perhaps the most important activity in any business. And by sell, I mean getting out there and meeting people and talking to them and probably persuading them. 

I haven&#8217;t, in my 30+ years of existence, ever initiated a conversation with a stranger. I usually take 1-2 days to even become comfortable talking professional stuff. It&#8217;s usually quite some time before I would engage in casual chats! So, what I am seeking to do is just the opposite of who I am! 

And I know I need to change.
