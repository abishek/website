I was in Chennai last week. I had to go out someplace and I had hired a cab since I am not very keen in driving in Chennai any more. It was a 40 minute drive one way and it was a pretty hot day. The cabbie was the only relief all along the drive although both my wife and my mom found him a tad too annoying.

The man was naturally gifted at talking. He spoke a naturally funny dialect of tamil. And he picked up topics from the road. Every street name, car, building, office space that we cross, he had something to quip. Some where just a rant or a while, but a lot many were just good humor. It is clear that he doesn&#8217;t mind. That&#8217;s like the best stand up comedy show I have been in &#8211; not that I have been in a lot. I listen to them a lot.

It was fun. If I get a chance to meet him again, maybe I&#8217;ll ask him to consider creating a set that he can play over youtube or something. I&#8217;d be glad to help him get some stage, assuming things to work in a straightforward manner.
