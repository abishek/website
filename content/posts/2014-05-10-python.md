Perhaps the best tool I ever learnt. I still remembering my boss mentioning this in a casual chat and encouraging us to learn Python. Sometime in 2005, I think. I learnt the basic usage in about a week. 

Python has been my language of choice since then. Its a little sad to think I have not quite mastered the language till date! I still have a long way to go before I can claim to be good in python.
